     <div class="caption"><h1>What is a Server </h1> Imagine you have a magical computer that can learn things on its own, just like how you learn new things every day. This special computer is called a server in machine learning.

      The server is like a big brain that can store a lot of information and use it to solve problems. It can learn from examples and make predictions. For example, if you show the server pictures of 
      
       different animals, it can learn to recognize them and tell you if it's a cat, a dog, or something else.
      
      The server needs a lot of power to do all this thinking and learning, just like how your brain needs energy to think and learn. It has special parts called processors that help it process information quickly. Think of these processors as the muscles of the server.
      
      Sometimes, the server needs more power to solve really big problems or learn from a lot of data. In those cases, it can have extra processors called GPUs. GPUs are like supercharged muscles that help the server learn even faster.
      
      The server can also talk to other computers or devices. It can share what it has learned or help other computers make decisions. It does this by sending information over the internet, just like how you can talk to your friends using a phone or a computer.</div>
